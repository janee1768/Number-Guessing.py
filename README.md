### 🎯 Number Guessing Game – Python Project

This is a fun and simple Python game where the computer randomly picks a number, and the user has to guess what it is. The goal is to guess the correct number in as few tries as possible.

### 🕹️ How the Game Works

When the program starts, it asks the user to enter a maximum number. The computer then randomly picks a secret number between **0 and that maximum number**.

The user is then asked to make a guess. After each guess:

* If the guess is too low, the program says **"You are below the number!"**
* If the guess is too high, it says **"You are above the number!"**
* If the guess is correct, it says **"You got it!"** and ends the game

The program also counts how many guesses the user makes and shows the total number at the end.

### ✅ Features

* Takes a custom top number from the user
* Picks a random number each time
* Gives hints to guide the user (higher or lower)
* Tells how many guesses were made
* Uses basic Python functions and logic

### 🧠 What You Learn

This project helps beginners understand:

* `input()` and `print()` functions
* Using `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements
* `while True` loops
* Random number generation using `random.randint()`
* Basic error handling
